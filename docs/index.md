<p style='margin-left:1em; padding: 10px'>
API keys plays a major role in the field of software. API (Application programming interface) is the way to pass JSON objects between servers.
That is essentialy something that your application need to do many times, but you will not be able to see it as it is happenning behind the  scenes. When talking about OpenAI API keys, you will get one free but only with 3 requests per minutes, therefore it is highly recommended to set up a billing plan and have the API key set up from the API panel.
<br><br>
After you setup the plan, you can enter the provided link and generate a new key. Note that your key will be visible only when it is generated, therefore it is important you will copy and keep it safe until you add it to your application.
